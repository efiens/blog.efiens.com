EFIENS is a cyber security club comprised primarily of students and alumni from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT). We were founded to provide resources and study environment to those interested in exploring the world of cyber security.

At our core, we are a group of self-taught security enthusiasts who enjoy sharing our knowledge with those interested in learning. We believe in the freedom of information, and do our best to prepare resources, organize meetings, and host educational events on our own time.
